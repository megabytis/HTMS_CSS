          Protein is an important component of every cell in the body. <br>
          <em>Hair and nails are mostly made of protein. </em><br> 
          Your body uses protein to build and repair tissues. <br>
          <em>You also use protein to make enzymes, hormones, and other body chemicals.</em> <br>
          Protein is an important building block of <strong>B</strong>ones, <strong>M</strong>uscles, <strong>C</strong>artilage,<strong>S</strong>kin, and <strong>B</strong>lood. <br>

          <h2>6 Important Functions of Protein ü•ô in Your Body</h2>
          <p>
            Protein is crucial to good health.<br>
            In fact, the name comes from the Greek word proteos, meaning ‚Äúprimary‚Äù or ‚Äúfirst place.‚Äù<br>
            Proteins are made up of amino acids that join together to form long chains. You can think of a protein as a string of beads in which each bead is an amino acid.<br>
            There are 20 amino acids that help form the thousands of different proteins in your body.<br>
            Proteins do most of their work in the cell and perform various jobs.<br>
            Here are 6 important functions of protein in your body.<br>
            They are :- <br>
            <ol>
              <li>Growth and Maintenance</li>
              <li>Causes Biochemical Reactions</li>
              <li> Acts as a Messenger</li>
              <li> Provides Structure</li>
              <li>Maintains Proper pH</li>
              <li>Balances Fluids</li>
            </ol>
            Now lets' discuss all these functions in detail.

          <h3>1. Growth and Maintenance</h3>

          <p>
            Your body needs protein for growth and maintenance of tissues.<br>
            Yet, your body's proteins are in a constant state of turnover.<br>
            Under normal circumstances, your body breaks down the same amount of protein that it uses to build and repair tissues. Other times, it breaks down more protein than it can create, thus increasing your body's needs.<br>
            This typically happens in periods of illness, during pregnancy and while breastfeeding .
            
            People recovering from an injury or surgery, older adults and athletes require more protein as well .<br> 
          </p>

          <h3>Causes Biochemical Reactions</h3>
          <p>
            Enzymes ü¶† are proteins that aid the thousands of biochemical reactions that take place within and outside of your cells<br>
            The structure of enzymes allows them to combine with other molecules inside the cell called substrates, which catalyze reactions that are essential to your metabolism <br>
            Enzymes may also function outside the cell, such as digestive enzymes like lactase and sucrase, which help digest sugar.<br>
            Bodily functions that depend on enzymes include<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Energy production</li>
              <li>Digestion</li>
              <li>Detoxification</li>
              <li>Blood clotting</li>
              <li>Cell growth and division</li>
            
            </ul>
