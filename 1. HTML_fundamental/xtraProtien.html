      <h3> 
      Protien also Acts as a Messenger
      </h3>
      <p>
      Some proteins are hormones, which are chemical messengers that aid communication between your cells, tissues and organs.<br>
      They're made and secreted by endocrine tissues or glands and then transported in your blood to their target tissues or organs where they bind to protein receptors on the cell surface.<br>
      Protein and polypeptides make up most of your body's hormones.<br>
      Some examples include <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Insulin: </li>
        <li>Glucagon: </li>
        <li>Insulin:</li>
        <li>hGH (human growth hormone): </li>
        <li>ADH (antidiuretic hormone): </li>
        <li>ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone): </li>
      </ul>
